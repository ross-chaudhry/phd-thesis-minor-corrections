% -- Main corrections
% -- All references to original document should be hardcoded - they are unchangeable and format should be fine
\begin{enumerate}

\item
The estimated uncertainty for the conditional PDF, $\myerror\fe$,
   shown in Equation~(2.38) on page~38, should use $\myP\left(e\right)$
   instead of $\myP\left(\ol{c}\right)$.
The corrected equation is,
%
\begin{align*}
   \myerror \fe\left(\ol{c}\right) &= \fe\left(\ol{c}\right) \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\myerror \myP\left(e \cap \ol{c}\right)}{\myP\left(e \cap \ol{c}\right)}\right)^2
                                                                  + \left(\frac{\myerror \myP\left(           e \right)}{\myP\left(           e \right)}\right)^2 }
\end{align*}

\item
Reference~[129] in the thesis, cited on page~95,
   does not include the journal number, volume, or pages.
Reference~[90] in the thesis is the same citation and it includes the missing information.
Thus, Ref.~[129] on page~158 should be replaced by Ref.~[90],
   and bibliography entry~[129] on page~158 should be removed.

\item
The last two rows of data in Table~3.3, on page~113, should be labeled as collision partner $\ce{M}=\ce{O2}$
   instead of \ce{N2}.
Note that errors in the numbers of most tables are unlikely,
   because the raw data are mostly autogenerated from the QCT database itself.

\item
The author list for Ref.~[26], listed on page~149, was parsed incorrectly.
It should be ``Jaffe, R. L., Schwenke, D. W., and Panesi, M.''.

% % -- Include very minor formatting errors? No for now, just looks silly
% \item
% On page 30, a period is missing in the main text after footnote 2.
% 
% \item
% On page 74, two commas are used instead of one in the fourth line.

\end{enumerate}
